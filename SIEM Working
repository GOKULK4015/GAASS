SIEM tools work by gathering event and log data created by host systems, applications and security devices, such as antivirus filters and firewalls, throughout a company's infrastructure and bringing that data together on a centralized platform. The SIEM tools identify and sort the data into such categories as successful and failed logins, malware activity and other likely malicious activity.
The SIEM software then generates security alerts when it identifies potential security issues. Using a set of predefined rules, organizations can set these alerts as low or high priority.
For instance, a user account that generates 25 failed login attempts in 25 minutes could be flagged as suspicious but still be set at a lower priority because the login attempts were probably made by the user who had probably forgotten his login information.
However, a user account that generates 130 failed login attempts in five minutes would be flagged as a high-priority event because it's most likely a brute-force attack in progress.
