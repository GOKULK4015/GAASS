Some of the benefits of SIEM include the following:

shortens the time it takes to identify threats significantly, minimizing the damage from those threats;
offers a holistic view of an organization's information security environment, making it easier to gather and analyze security information to keep systems safe -- all of an organization's data goes into a centralized repository where it is stored and easily accessible;
can be used by companies for a variety of use cases that revolve around data or logs, including security programs, audit and compliance reporting, help desk and network troubleshooting;
supports large amounts of data so organizations can continue to scale out and increase their data;
provides threat detection and security alerts; and
can perform detailed forensic analysis in the event of major security breaches.
